# Magnetosphere
RPC APIs for misc modern Nintendo consoles/emulators, written in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)).

## Features

- Communication abstractions are provided in the Magnetosphere class library, and can be reused in other projects.
- An example main hub is presented by Geotail, and acts as a testing bed for misc interactions.

* [NTR](https://github.com/44670/NTR)'s TCP/IP based API
* [Atmosph√®re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)'s (future) API
